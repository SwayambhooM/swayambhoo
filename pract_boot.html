    			Bootstrap 3 supports the latest versions of the Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari (except on Windows). It additionally supports back to IE8 and the latest Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR).[12]

                  Since 2.0, Bootstrap supports responsive web design. This means the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the device used (desktop, tablet, mobile phone).

						Starting with version 3.0, Bootstrap adopted a mobile-first design philosophy, emphasizing responsive design by default.

										Version 4.0 added Sass and flexbox support.[9]

    		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    			<h4>Column 2(//structures and functions )</h4>    			
    			 Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of Less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components.

				Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings.

				As of Bootstrap 4, Sass is used instead of Less for the stylesheets.

				Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.

				Grid system and responsive design comes standard with an 1170 pixel wide grid layout. Alternatively, the developer can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the width of the columns.

    		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    			<h4>Column 3(//struc. and func. cont.)</h4>    	Stylesheets
				Bootstrap provides a set of stylesheets that provide basic style definitions for all key HTML components. These provide a uniform, modern appearance for formatting text, tables and form elements.

				Re-usable components
				In addition to the regular HTML elements, Bootstrap contains other commonly used interface elements. The components are implemented as CSS classes, which must be applied to certain HTML elements in a page.

				JavaScript components
				Bootstrap comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields. In version 1.3[13], the following JavaScript plugins are supported: Modal, Dropdown, Scrollspy, Tab, Tooltip, Popover, Alert, Button, Collapse, Carousel and Typeahead.

				On October 29, 2014, Mark Otto announced that Bootstrap 4 was in development.[8] On September 6, 2016, Mark suspended work on Bootstrap 3 in order to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4. Over 17,500 commits have been made to the Bootstrap 4 codebase so far.

				Bootstrap 4 stable version released on 18th Jan 2018, is a major rewrite from Bootstrap 3. Significant changes include:

				Switched from Less to Sass.
				Launched reboot in place of normalize css.
				Dropped IE8, IE9, and iOS 6 support.
				Added flexbox support and then dropped non-flexbox support.
				Added navigation customization options.
				Added responsive spacing and sizing utilities.
				Switched from pixels to root ems.
				Increased global font-size from 14px to 16px.
				Dropped the panel, thumbnail, and well components in favor of cards.
				Dropped the Glyphicons icon font.
				Dropped the pager component.
				Added huge number of utility classes.
				Improvised form styling.
				Improvised buttons and dropdowns.
				Improvised media objects and image classes.
				Rewrote almost all components, jQuery plugins and documentation.
